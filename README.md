# 🚀 DevOps Stage 1 — Automated Deployment Bash Script

 
This is a **production-grade Bash script** that automates the **complete setup, deployment, and configuration** of **Dockerized applications** on **remote Linux servers**.  

The script seamlessly manages every stage of deployment — from **Git repository cloning** and **environment preparation** to **Docker container orchestration** and **Nginx reverse proxy configuration** — all with robust **error handling**, **input validation**, and **detailed logging**.  

It’s designed to reflect real-world **DevOps automation practices**, emphasizing **reliability**, **idempotency**, and **ease of maintenance**. 💪

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Automated Setup** – Installs and configures Docker, Docker Compose, and Nginx on the remote server.  
- 🔐 **Secure Git Access** – Clones repositories using a Personal Access Token (PAT) with branch selection support.  
- 🧠 **Input Validation** – Ensures all parameters (SSH, repo, ports, etc.) are validated before proceeding.  
- 📜 **Error Handling & Logging** – Every action is logged in a timestamped log file for easy debugging.  
- 🌐 **Remote Deployment** – Uses SSH to securely execute commands and deploy applications remotely.  
- 🐳 **Dockerized Application Support** – Supports both `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` setups.  
- 🌍 **Nginx Reverse Proxy** – Automatically configures Nginx to route incoming traffic to the running container.  
- ♻️ **Idempotent Design** – Can be re-run without breaking existing setups; safely redeploys updates.  
- 🧹 **Cleanup Mode** – Includes an optional `--cleanup` flag to remove containers, images, and Nginx configs.
